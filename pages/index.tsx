            <h2>I code for growth</h2>

            <p>
              Since 2015 I have been coding digital products. Web apps, websites, e-commerces, PWAs,
              and mobile apps that have helped organizations of all sizes to refine their online
              presence and grow businesses.
            </p>

            <p>
              I specialize in front-end development. My main focus is on UX, web standards,
              performance, progressive enhancement, accessibility, security, tests and analytics.
              Adjacent back-end with cloud services, CI/CD, containers, databases and APIs
              integrations.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm the founder of{' '}
              <a href="https://findto.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
                Findto - AI decentralized search
              </a>{' '}
              because I believe on the power of open Web community. I also create tech content and
              translate programming docs for devs.
            </p>

            <p>
              I was born in Amazon region of Brazil, maybe is why I love to travel and face new
              experiences. I am a person who greatly values communication, innovation and respect.
