            <h2>I'm a growth coder</h2>

            <p>
              Since 2015 I've been coding digital products. Web apps, websites, e-commerce, PWAs and
              mobile apps that have helped organizations of all sizes, establish a polished online
              presence, achieve results and grow their businesses.
            </p>

            <p>
              I specialize in front-end development of reactive and component-based UIs with a
              strong focus on UX, performance, accessibility, progressive enhancement, security, web
              standards and data analytics. Adjacent back-end with API and database integrations,
              containers, cloud services and CI/CD.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm the founder of{' '}

              </a>{' '}
              because I believe on the power of open web. I also create tech content and contribute
              with open source programming docs to support devs community.
