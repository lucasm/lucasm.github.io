            <h2>I love to build, together</h2>

            <p>
              Since 2015 I've been coding digital products. Web apps, websites, e-commerce, PWAs and
              mobile apps that have helped organizations of all sizes stand out online presence and
              grow their businesses.
            </p>

            <p>
              I specialize in front-end development. I build reactive and component-based UIs with a
              strong focus on UX, performance, accessibility, progressive enhancement, security, web
              standards and user analytics. Adjacent back-end with cloud services, APIs, databases,
              containers, CI/CD and integrations.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm the founder of{' '}
              <a href="https://findto.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
                Findto - AI decentralized search
              </a>{' '}
              because I believe on the power of open Web community. I also create tech content and
              translate programming docs for devs.
            </p>

            <p>
              More than Computer Science, I'm a lifelong learner, born in the Amazon region of
              Brazil, and maybe is why I like to travel and face new experiences. I highly value
              communication, innovation and respect.
