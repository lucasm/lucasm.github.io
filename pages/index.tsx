            <h2>I code for growth</h2>

            <p>
              Since 2015 I've been coding digital products: web apps, websites, e-commerces, PWAs
              and mobile apps that have helped organizations of all sizes stand out online presence
              and grow their businesses.
            </p>

            <p>
              I specialize in front-end development with focus on UX, performance, reactivity,
              componentization, progressive enhancement, accessibility, security, web standards and
              analytics. Adjacent back-end with cloud services, APIs, databases, containers and
              CI/CD integrations.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm the founder of{' '}

                Findto - AI decentralized search
              </a>{' '}
              because I believe on the power of open Web community. I also create tech content and
              translate programming docs for devs.
            </p>

            <p>
              I was born in Amazon region of Brazil, I love to travel, face new experiences and I
              highly value innovation and respect for all peoples. Nice to see you =)
