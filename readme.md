# [lucasmauess.github.io](http://lucasmauess.github.io/)

A personal website hosted directly from my GitHub repository

## purpose of this project

The objective of this repository is to gather information about me in a single web page, such as links to my profiles on social networks, information to contact, a blog to share ideas about programming and development (coming soon) and mainly promote my projects and my contributions in the open source community. Do not need to explain why I chose GitHub for it =D
